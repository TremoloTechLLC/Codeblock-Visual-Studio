# Welcome to the official repository for Codeblock Visual Studio! #

What is Codeblock Visual Studio? The final goal is to create a simple,
block-based IDE that can code in powerful languages such as Python instead
of a "lite" language. (Looking at you, Scratch.)

# IMPORTANT: THERE IS A LOT OF REPOSITORY WORK TO DO #

Due to moving from a one-person project to an actually good structured one,
we need to set up the repository branch systems properly (also I will be pretty mad
if you manage to delete all my work)

When you are developing, open a new Issue (see left) describing what you are doing
and create a branch for that issue. Open a pull request when you are finished.

DO NOT EDIT THE MASTER BRANCH OR DEVELOP BRANCH UNLESS EXPLICITLY GIVEN PERMISSION.
