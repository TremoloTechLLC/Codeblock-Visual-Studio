# Welcome to the official repository for Codeblock Visual Studio! #

What is Codeblock Visual Studio? The final goal is to create a simple,
block-based IDE that can code in powerful languages such as Python instead
of a "lite" language.

When you are developing, open a new Issue (see left) describing what you are doing
and create a branch for that issue. Open a pull request when you are finished.

DO NOT EDIT THE MASTER BRANCH UNLESS EXPLICITLY GIVEN PERMISSION.
DO NOT PUSH CHANGES TO DEVELOP UNTIL STABLE.
